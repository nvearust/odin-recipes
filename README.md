# odin-recipes
This is a project I made as a participation in The Odin Project with goals of learning Full Stack Development.

## What is this project?
This is the first project in The Odin Project, it gives the speciation of making a recipes website, with pure HTML. I will be adding a little bit of css though, since this is not my first time interacting with the two languages, and hopefully it turns out nice.

## How does this website work?
The website has a home page (index.html) and this home page is kind of the menu for the website. It is an index of all the other recipes. It has links to the other recipes and images that show how they (may) look like when done. The recipes were AI generated due to the hassle I find with getting my recipe from a website, where I may incidentally steal someone else's recipe and they may not like that, in Any case someone may not like that please feel free to contact me and I will get your image/content taken down.
