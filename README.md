# odin-recipes
This is a project I made as a participation in The Odin Project with goals of learning Full Stack Development.

## What is this project?
This is the first project in The Odin Project, it gives the speciation of making a recipes website, with pure HTML.I will be adding a little bit of css though, since this is not my first time interacting with the two languages, and hopefully it turns out nice.

## How does this website work?
